Footnotes:
1,"In general, for police-reported incidents that involve violations against the person, a victim record is collected for each victim involved in the incident. If an individual is a victim in multiple incidents in the same reference year, that individual will be counted as one victim for each incident. Some victims experience violence over a period of time, sometimes years, all of which may be considered by the police to be part of one continuous incident and are counted as a single victim. Victim records are not required for all violent violations, but are accepted, for some violent offences such as uttering threats and criminal harassment."
2,"Data are from the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR2) Trend Database, which contains historical data that permit the analysis of trends since 2009 in the characteristics of incidents, and accused and victim characteristics, such as age, gender and accused–victim relationship. This database includes respondents accounting for 99% of the population of Canada."
3,"A census metropolitan area (CMA) consists of one or more neighbouring municipalities situated around a major urban core. A CMA must have a total population of at least 100,000, of which 50,000 or more live in the urban core. To be included in the CMA, other adjacent municipalities must have a high degree of integration with the central urban core, as measured by commuting flows derived from census data. A CMA typically comprises more than one police service. CMA populations have been adjusted to follow policing boundaries. The Oshawa CMA is excluded from this analysis owing to the incongruity between the police service jurisdictional boundaries and the CMA boundaries. Belleville and Lethbridge became CMAs as of the 2016 Census. In 2022, coverage for each CMA was virtually 100%, except in Toronto (90%) and Hamilton (75%). As a result, counts and rates may differ from information from other sources."
4,"Rates are calculated on the basis of 100,000 population in each age and gender group unless otherwise noted for specific relationships. Populations based on July 1 estimates from Statistics Canada, Centre for Demography. Rates for victims with unknown age or unknown gender are not available for any reference period, as population estimates cannot be applied to calculate rates where these elements are unknown."
5,"Victim age is calculated based on the end date of an incident, as reported by the police. Some victims experience violence over a period of time, sometimes years, all of which may be considered by the police to be part of one continuous incident."
6,"Sexual violations against children are a set of Criminal Code violations that specifically concern violations involving child and youth victims. These include violations such as sexual interference, invitation to sexual touching and sexual exploitation, but exclude sexual assault and other sexual violations not specific to children."
7,"Includes dangerous operation of a motor vehicle, failure to stop and other Criminal Code traffic violations."
